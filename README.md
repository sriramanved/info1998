# Predicting the presence of Diabetes Mellitus using Machine Learning

My final project for INFO 1998. Used a Kaggle Dataset to experiment with the ML algorithms we learned in class.

## Implementation

- Created a classifier to predict diabetes using risk metrics (blood pressure, BMI, etc.) in Jupyter Notebooks using ML libraries sklearn, pandas, and seaborn
- Implemented k Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, and Random Forests (Bagging) to determine the presence of Diabetes 
- Evaluated our results with confusion matrices and graphical visualizations using matplotlib

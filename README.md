# info1998 final project
Final project for INFO 1998: Predicting the presence of Diabetes Mellitus using Machine Learning models on several indicators.

- Created a classifier to predict diabetes using risk metrics (blood pressure, BMI, etc.) in Jupyter Notebooks using ML libraries sklearn, pandas, and seaborn
- Implemented k Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, and Random Forests (Bagging) to determine the presence of Diabetes 
- Evaluated our results with confusion matrices and graphical visualizations using matplotlib
